Mass Extinctions:

Cases in which many species 

become extinct within 

a geologically short interval of time are called

mass extinctions. 

There was one such event at the end of the 

Cretaceous period

ok

even larger, mass 

extinction at the end of the 

Permian period (around 250 million years ago). 

The Permian event has attracted much less attention 

than other mass extinctions because mostly unfamiliar 

species perished at that time.

American paleontologists 

David Raup and John Sepkoski, 

who have studied extinction rates in a number of fossil groups, 

suggest that episodes of increased extinction have 

recurred periodically, 

approximately every 26 million years since the 

mid-Cretaceous period. 

The late Cretaceous extinction of the dinosaurs and 

ammonoids was just one 

of the more drastic in a whole series of such recurrent 

The possibility that mass extinctions may recur 

periodically has given rise to such hypotheses 

as that of a companion star 

with a long-period orbit deflecting other bodies from 

their normal orbits, 

making some of them fall to Earth as meteors and 

causing widespread 

devastation upon impact.
